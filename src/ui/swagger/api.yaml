      summary: Authenticate user.
      description: |
        Authenticate a user. User authentication is performed using JWT token generation. In generating the JWT token, there are following types of attributes:

        **Reserved Claims**: Non-mandatory (but recommended) attributes used in token validation by API security protocols. These are used to create a pattern and are defined in RFC-7519.
        * sub () - Entity that the token belongs to, usually the user ID (it is good practice that this ID is not the same as the database);
        * aud (audience) - The token recipient represents the application (client) that will use it. In conjunction with iss it is possible to restrict or allow access to certain groups (called audience) if they are in the correct aud;
        * iss (emitter) - sets the emitter of the token;
        * exp (expiration) - Timestamp of when the token will expire;
        * iat (issued at) - Timestamp from when the token was created.

        **Public claims**: Attributes that are not part of the pattern, and are defined especially for sharing information between applications.

        * scopes - A developer-defined attribute that specifies token access scopes.

        **Example of values that compose the payload:**


        ```json
        {
          "sub": "5accb6215ba48413e81e7853e",

        To filter a collection by multiple concurrent attributes or filter
        multiple values for an attribute, simply use the attribute/property
        name with an equal sign and the expected values, separated by a comma.
        **_property=value1,value2,value3_**. The query is not case sensitive.
        Example: **_?name=elvis,john_** to retrieve exactly the same users with
        elvis or john name.
        For filtering with logical operators, just follow the syntax:
        **_property=operator:value_**. The available operators are:
         - **gt** -> Defines which value of the attribute is greater than
                    (that is,>) the specified value.
         - **gte** -> Defines which attribute value is greater than or equal to
                    (that is,>=) the specified value.
         - **lt** -> Define the value of the attribute to be less than (that is, <)
                    the specified value.
         - **lte** -> Defines which value of the attribute is less than or equal to
                    (that is, <=) the specified value.

        Example: **_?field1=gte:80&age=lt:100_** to recover the users with age
        is greater than or equal to 80 and less then 100.
